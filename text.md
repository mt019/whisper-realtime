 reform of the pension
 for a civil servant.
 That means the...

 Yes, I was very angry, okay?
 Okay, so return to our

 That's not a too vague question, because you mentioned.
 And that's measure two examples in regard to.
 regarding new challenges to social.
 One is related to the new
 Risk another ESV, it gets you a little tired.
 which is a kind of a new economic...
 and many of the solutions.
 as far as I understand.
 It seems that you still...
 You're still discussing Lee's challenge.
 under the current framework of social protection.
 But at the end of your presentation, you mentioned...
 the files of the universal basic income.
 consistent, which seems to be a kind of difference.
 approach appear to occur.
 of social protection approaches that you may have.
 and compensation insurance affordances.
 So I'm just wondering that...
 For you when you come to those
 new challenges, either they're new risks or new...
 Ways of production do you think it's bad?
 to examine this kind of question.
 What are the current social professions?
 We need to consider this issue by thinking...

 issue and I kind of want to echo
 That's Professor Chen's comment in the end.
 regarding the platform importance.
 of protection issue versus change.
 that we deal with this issue with the kind of...
 a dimensional approach, which means that you...
 because once there's a question, we kind of deal with it.
 in contrast to deal with this
 issue in a more holistic way to reach.

 So I'm just wondering, how do you think...
 about this issue, should we still keep...
 current framework or should we kind of
 create a new framework, for example.
 Thank you.
 Thanks.
 Thanks for watching!
 We will connect some percent...
 there and enter for the first one.
 Thanks for watching!
 Thank you.
 Maybe I'll start outside in the meantime.
 Does it work? Does it? Yeah, it still works. Okay.
 Yes, thank you very much.
 a very good and I think the most fun.
 The next question, of course, you can...
 ask in a certain way because
 The question is, how to...
 Okay, let me start this way. I would say...
 And yes, I think that we can sort.
 a lot of problems by it.
 by the way of incrementality, as you put it, I think that...
 It's nicely coded.
 So we have to increment.
 the central ways of dealing with it.
 I was going to say we have some improvements of the...
 already existing schemes for adapting of the...
 systems in an incremental way, which means we don't...
 I'm going to change the systems, let me just say, change.
 a couple of things, like view it.
 use the pensions of the civil servants.
 But no, it's also one of these incremental changes.
 changes due to the demographic processes.
 Thank you very much.
 Okay, that's about it.
 So, yeah, this is.
 It's really important for the UBI.
 discussion, I think, because I would...
 I would argue, if you can't change things...
 is incrementing anymore, right?
 There's no way to do it that way.
 Then you be like my.
 And the only solution is that way.
 So that's.
 Indeed, that would be my approach to it.
 But not everybody argues like this.
 I think that's also important.
 People who prefer EDI...
 as an alternative to the existing...
 Thank you.
 And this, of course, there is no electromagnetic.
 thing, because changing the history from tradition.
 Social Security, I guess it's nearly...
 to be honest, but it's, yeah, I mean.
 That's a task force, I don't know what...
 might be out there, but they are beautiful.
 for normative reasons, and this is also important, I think.
 These are two different ways of arguing for...
 You could say that UBI is...
 on the normative point of view of the tech revolution.
 .
 The normatively the better thing would be...
 to say, okay, nobody is obliged to work.
 So the idea that people are obliged.
 to do something in a political community or...
 in this society is
 This is not true.
 I believe in this traditional thinking.
 Okay, then UBI is the data system anyway.
 I wouldn't share this view.
 I would say, OK, you can be.
 the argument might come up if we are not able.
 to solve our problems incrementally.
 then UBI might be the only possible solution or something.
 Okay, these are two ways of...
 And, okay, if you take now the...
 My idea is so...
 Aren't we doomed to have things of value?
 incremental changes, I would say, yes, I think we...

 Utilization will change our lives.
 market in such a way.
 in a fundamental way, then deep talk.
 additional systems wouldn't work anymore.
 But I don't know.
 What do you want?
 Tell me!
 Look!
 Look!
 a lot of podcasts and...
 and things, it might be science fiction rather.
 More fiction than science, I guess
 look out there, but there are some of these visionary ideas.
 everything will change. We are radicals.
 Thanks for watching!
 So first of all we should look at the infirmary.
 And this is one way you can
 So this is interesting and I...
 I think this breaks us to...
 As I said, I believe that...
 it has to be done by the way another
 The interesting question is what do we call incremental and what do we...
 we call more structural or substantial.
 So that's also an interesting question.
 Where is the turning point between incremental and...
 the total change of things.
 I don't know, I mean.
 you see the pension for students.
 specific groups of persons or you've seen...
 They, they, I guess.
 they are incremental, they can work to a certain degree.
 If you have, for example, a heartbreak tension
 on a certain minimum.
 They do not work anymore, so then...
 Okay, so that's a very big...
 difficult thing. Now, for this, for this
 I think that's interesting.
 Maybe, maybe I could ask you a question.
 Professor, I ask if I understand.
 So the proposal comes...
 from smaller parties.
 Thank you.
 Okay, very simple question.
 How realistic is it that it will become the law?
 Thanks for watching!
 Is it just a graph because it's a nice idea or really?
 Is it, is it, is it weird this, uh, no?
 In a moment, it'd be...

 So, please, another question.
 Thank you for watching.
 Thanks for watching!
 May I have a following?
 the question just, um, UBI, uh...
 is the
 On eight a lot
 In some countries
 It was a kind of UBI.
 Can we still define this?
 I would say very much
 depends on whether it's needs tested or not.
 If it's not meets the standards, so we're talking...
 about unconditional old age and old age.
 Then, of course, this is a form of UBI.
 It's just for the other people, so it just protects them.
 This is a group of people.
 So, but I totally.
 Anyways, we can have different forms of UVI for the edi-
 That's one solution we know for unimportant...
 For example, we sometimes have it as well.
 and the more radical idea for everything.
 All right, so just you don't want to wake, so it's okay.
 So the very good idea is you, as you do not have to...
 be obliged to work so there's no more
 No obligation, no legal of course anyway.
 So if there is no more obligation, so if there is no more...
 obligation because I mean the capitalism
 works as it does.
 Then you get it, just if you don't.
 But in other cases you will have...
 for the different risks in a certain way we already know.
 of old age, unemployment, and so on.
 And then again, you could.
 say, okay, we make it unconditional so we don't base it.
 I do not see why you...
 We should do that, but I have to say...
 The problem is, the big problem is with the...
 with these schemes is if you have a contributor.
 schemes and non-contributary schemes at the end of the year.
 at the same time, so you do it.
 I have to have good reasons for justice.
 find these different ways of organizing.
 So I'm, I'm, I would be...
 skeptical of it, which is interesting.
 That's one, and we find it from time to time.
 time as an additional benefit so that's...
 Sometimes, in a certain way...
 We even have you think of old age.
 We have this form of ganache.
 Minimum pensions, for example, a day, a game...
 you could say it's not based on contribution.
 based on Texas, even in the Scandinavian country.
 is where we have this minimum pension, for example, is.
 It's normally paid by Texas.
 I would say these are quite camps a week.
 close to UPI for the elderly.
 in a certain way, because it's paid from Texas, and it's...
 It's a condition of course in most cases.
 is still unconditional, then it's...
 but this would be the person. I'm a bit sceptical, I would say.
 Normally, you should only spend tax money.
 Make it conditional, generally speaking.
 because otherwise the justification for contributions
 It erodes from all of this.
 that's at least the danger you're running.
 And I think it's interesting.
 for your solution. I have to come back to this again.
 because I have two points which come in.
 in my mind.
 The first one is if you just...
 Let's take this one group of persons.
 What was the proper term back then?
 by the way for this.
 and it would be the English term for it.
 I don't know what is the...
 Yeah, it's delivery persons.
 Deliver, deliver.
 and so forth.
 Thanks.
 I mean, there, there are good reasons.
 to say they are really close to employment.
 In many of these cases, you might even...
 I wouldn't argue if you just do your long drive over it.
 Okay, they employed on us anyway, okay, so
 This is very close.
 So this is why you might.
 in tega, da se očekaj, da se naša solčina našiči.
 Second point, which is also very important, this is a great...
 of the specific platform work.
 where the platform industry is...
 interested in being on the market.
 So this means that you have...
 good chances we need to get the contribution from the...
 from the platform industry.
 It's totally different if you...
 Transborder activities
 platforms, they will become much, much more difficult.
 So we thought about if he
 Take contributions from the platform industry in order to find it.
 social protection in whatever form, actually.
 it's very difficult to actually get it.
 in many cases, because if you have transport...
 activities. So the question is how...
 How can you actually get it?
 How get your own?
 of the money, so there's a couple of...
 approaches in the European Union, how you can do it, but I don't know.
 about the other transporter.
 activities that would become difficult.
 I think for your question, so that's that's it.
 But then again by the way, it's interesting
 I mean, you could argue with the motion.
 general fashion because he's saying it's a, it's a balance
 and seeing the capitalism and the labor.
 forces in a certain way, right, so.
 That's what we actually did.
 by introducing this differentiation.
 as we have it in our labor laws in terms of security.
 but it's exactly which type to balance it by.
 And we made the decisions to save the world.
 and not the economic dependencies.
 So this is exactly how we solved it.
 So the question is, at least if...
 should take the argumentation of the code.
 the Taipei Higher Administrative...
 which I thought is really interesting.
 But it's not legal, it's not so much
 The legal reasoning may be, I don't know, it's...
 It seems a bit like a political reasoning, which I totally understand.
 But first of all, you might need a role.
 in order to do it safe and still.
 This shit is okay, then you step back for more people.
 introduced in order to make it work.
 conditions. We might have, we might have to...
 a very considerate condition that we would have to think about.
 Thanks for watching!
 going back to the economic events.
 Because this is what you actually do, and this is what you do.
 The courts and the laws actually do not do it.
 And then you could say, okay, there are good reasons for...
 for going back to this, but there's the question.
 So I guess you would have to discuss it a bit more fundamentally.
 at the end, even if you have this small group of...
 This is where I see, yeah, okay, they might even.
 to be personally, if you can, to be honest,
 so I think that's not such.
 It's actually difficult, but if you go back to this.
 Very, very open-term balancing.
 capitalism and labor forces.
 So then you will also have to rethink how we...
 to do is you know what moments they go into it.
 I don't give
 an answer to that, but I think you have to discuss it.
 ac rydych chi ddim yn ymwneud yw'r Llywodraeth.
 I have to say this, I'm afraid.
 That's something for scientists.
 We can't expect policy makers.
 to lead these discussions.
 Unfortunately, maybe.
 Thank you.
 Thanks for watching!
 Thanks for watching!
 Thank you.
 You have mentioned that there's some universal
 basic income schemes in housing.
 in the lower camp early, I guess.
 I was, I'm curious about that.
 Is there any...
 problem happening due to the...
 the eyes is to inside.
 I'm in Hanford right now.
 Спасибо за просмотр!
 Do you have a problem?
 Maybe, is there any risk happening?
 maybe in some...
 and
 Thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
 Okay, and you mean, why have I been so...
 skeptical about this because of the...
 but skepticism I have, I have to say that, okay.
 for this experiment.
 You have to see the problem with that is that it's...
 sponsored by private initiatives because we need to have someone
 of course. Then you select, I don't know, in the case...
 of Berlin, I think it was 1,000 person or maybe...
 It was 100, I don't remember, but not 100.
 than 1,000 at least. Let's say it was 1,000.
 You choose 1,000 persons and you give them...
 For one year, I think it was.
 You give them this universal basic income.
 You just give them the money.
 And then you say, okay, let's see, by the way.
 They're still working, and they did.
 And then you say, okay, you'll see all this.
 these advantages of UBI you make the people...
 They can do whatever they want.
 They still have a good morale, they're still working.
 And they did it in the most ways.
 And then they say, oh, I'm so relieved now, I'm not.
 I'm not feeling like a slave anymore, so I can do what I want.
 whatever I want and this motivates people to do that.
 I mean, that's a bit, I don't know.
 But that's a big one, I think.
 And as I said, I think under these conditions...
 where you, no, it's just, it's so.
 I think for not more than one year.
 You get, you, you, you, you go to, at least, I think...
 I think it was enough money in order to live.
 of this money and so on.
 So I think you can't.
 really measure whether people wouldn't change.
 their behavior, and this is what it's about at the end.
 at the end. I mean, the risk is that people do...
 We don't want to work anymore and it's not everybody...
 is in this happy situation as we are.
 We are scientists, we laugh all the way, sometimes.
 Most of them, most of them.
 We love it.
 But I need the help of other people and they do not...
 like to work every day, I mean, they like to work every day they need.
 but they have some problems, and so they are the...
 Yeah.
 So if you see this background, I'm really scared.
 I was just thinking whether you can, with this small.
 small probation.
 whether you can really measure.
 So this is why I'm so skeptical.
 And the other thing is, it's a very...
 interesting for the UBI, if you see on the Morpheus...
 theoretical, from a more theoretical perspective.
 who is in favor of UVI.
 First of all, it's these people who think, okay...
 It makes people free because they do not have the plan.
 anymore. That's the one on the left this side. Okay?
 of the spectrum, if you want to.
 But then you...
 We also have the other side.
 together companies, we think it's a good thing if...
 We take it out of Texas, we're not responsible anymore.
 And they're very different ideas how much money
 people should get.
 I mean, it's nice if you get the
 lot of money and have a nice week and a nice weekend.
 You can go to the cinema and to the restaurant from time to time.
 then it's right but if you have the
 ideas which some companies...
 actually have that you just get a minimum in order to
 have enough pleasure still to do other things.
 then it's probably the other way around, isn't it?
 much worse than social insurance because social insurance gets you...
 a certain living standard, at least.
 So you see, you can use this idea for this one.
 very different political reasons as well.
 But again, my skepticism against...
 These things of trials is just because...
 There is a small group of people under...
 specific conditions and you can't...
 really say, okay, from this now, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
 culturally in a certain way, whether this will work or not.
 I don't, I don't, I don't, I just don't believe in this.
 Thank you very much.

 I wonder if we have also national...
 National Pension Act
 National Pensions
 Okay, there's a addition to the...
 Uh, uh, uh, normal.
 Thank you.
 skin is for non-workers.
 And this is a contributory.
 In principle, it's contributor recognition.
 but the people...
 that non-workers, some of them are very...
 very vulnerable workers.
 and some are caregivers at home.
 Um, they don't have a
 incentive to pay the contribution.
 Uh, now I think the contribution
 The current payment rate is only 40.
 Person
 at beginning
 2008
 Seventy-five percent.
 distribution payment rate, and now...
 Now it's only 40 persons.
 So, this skin doesn't...
 It doesn't work in the deep enough.
 that doesn't work well.
 but it's also a big problem for them.
 the old age pool, the old age pool.
 age pool, the problem of old age pool.
 So, we...
 Just think about how is the...
 I think the nation known
 tension scheme.
 We want to continue the contributory scheme.
 or we turn it to the...
 by text, by this, by text.
 and if we want to
 reform it to work to find
 I'll take finance allowance.
 This will be...
 some kind of UVL at the end.
 old age, yes.
 is a relationship.
 the skin to the
 worker
 But, uh, the insurance, there's, uh...
 a big problem, but we just think about...
 approach this is a one point
 And the other point is just
 Last year, we had a...
 more income input in our
 budget by the state budget moral
 Input then output
 means our state has more...
 I want more money.
 Do you understand?
 Let's hear the economic.
 that's very good and then we have more
 input than output.
 Yes.
 Yes, okay.
 And the majority of the majority

 and they decided to...
 Give every citizen

 Um...
 For...
 I think that's...
 ...irreasonable.
 Just one time
 10,000 and in...
 COVID-19 crisis.
 There are also such benefits.
 This is incentive to...

 in such a pandemic crisis.

 Maybe we can use the money.

 background, I think the UBI will...
 has become a topic.
 Yeah, in our social.
 social law and social policy discussion.
 Thanks for watching!
 No, I know, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's always
 is a discussion I did because of the...
 Thank you very much.
 for so many years now, so that I would say that the...
 wave of discussions I think I'm experiencing at the moment.
 But anyway, so it's always come up, and then it's here.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 sleep at the same time.
 You can't explain why you have to make them do it for the rest of the day.
 something or the other.
 So let's look at home.
 So if you're...
 .
 If you, for example, if you take this national pension...
 the system. I would say, yeah, then...
 then it would make sense to base it on Texas.
 and not to take contributions from those who can make...
 for the contributions and not to make it.
 speed system.
 So we're back.
 Maybe not the
 .
 same instance as for social assistance.
 to argue with.
 One could ask, but one could...
 You could have good reasons to say for the elderly...
 you have a different means test because they have
 I've done a lot of work in the meantime, and so on.
 They could please.
 for doing that. Not many countries do it, actually.
 But I think theoretically they're good ideas.
 to do it like this. So that's, that would be one.
 Solution, of course.
 And then you can...
 to get rid of all the contributions I made.
 Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah, you can always have a...
 I mean, it's just in this and what we only think is what you would say.
 Okay, for the elderly, if you make it a bit different, for example, you need...
 for posing or the essence you can accomplish.
 it's different here or something like this, you know.
 So because.
 because at the end, it's exactly the same.
 and it's a group of persons who can not make their living
 really on the labor market without subsidies.
 And if this is true, and if you want to subsidize these...
 For good reasons, I think.
 But then...
 It should be paid from Texas.
 Let's, I mean.
 So there's a background in it.
 What I really love is this.
 this idea that you get money back from your idea, you know?
 This reimbursement if you
 They pay too much taxes and they don't need it, they'll give you money.
 back to the citizens. I really love it. I think we should have...
 like that also, and he likes only both.
 for the politicians which have a positive budget.
 Last time we had a positive question.
 I don't know, I mean, yeah, we had one, but it's...
 No, but of course I'm joking.
 OK.
 I mean, no.
 But I think in a certain way you could say this is...
 the basic idea, but normally, you're wondering.
 because you wouldn't just spend money.
 You shouldn't.
 never do that, to be honest.
 We see it for a lot of other...
 reasons as well. If the state does it.
 People, people of course people like it.
 And people get used to this.
 because you can't take a baby.
 I mean, it doesn't make sense.
 You should have...
 Thank you.
 If you can't spend it because everything is time and
 and perfect, you just save it for the next period.
 It makes it easier, you could even think about...
 Maybe you have less taxes if you...
 You don't need it, I mean, wait, so that's OK, but you...
 We wouldn't just tell it all day.
 So that's the course.
 is sometimes good, and it's not the first...
 I think that we can see some...
 It is a good deal in order to get...
 of course, so that can be used.
 Sometimes, also, in Poland, the...
 regime did it. I have to say they...
 have a lot of family benefits, for example, so that this was...
 because they give the poor people some money and they say...
 This is for the Poland, for the national...
 So they will have a lot of national...
 I don't know if that's...
 Again, I mean this, I'm not going to use you.
 Thank you for watching.
 Thank you for watching.

 And another point that I had...

 I also mentioned that

 That's a weird joke, I suppose.

 So now there's a show time.

 I think that's what we have learned from the...

 because there again the question is how do you find it?
 At the beginning in Germany, the crisis...
 because we set tradition.
 This is a next event, we'll just find out what's going on.
 because when the numbers got up so high
